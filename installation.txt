Introduction
------------

This software package contains Groebner basis solvers generator as 
described in paper

Kukelova Z., Bujnak M., Pajdla T., Automatic Generator of Minimal 
Problem Solvers, ECCV 2008, Marseille, France, October 12-18, 2008

Please refer to the license.txt for licensing details.


Installation
-----------------------

This package does not require any installation. Package contains all 
necessary modules. By default the solvers generator uses Macaulay2 to 
compute Groefner basis (GB). Or it is possible to use Maple toolbox to 
compute GB.

Please refer to "generator\gbs_InitConfig.m" for further generator 
configuration. The file should be self explanatory enough.


Groebner basis solver
---------------------

We recommend to install Macaulay2 software package which provides fast and 
stable Groebner basis solver. 
Download it from "http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/" or install one 
(for Windows) located in prerequisites directory ("macaulay2-0.9.2-3.msi"). 

If you are using this package for Windows, update all "!!TODO:" labeled 
items in "gbsMacaulay\calc.bat". Please remove "!!TODO:" label and fill 
correct full paths to Macaulay2 installation directory according to 
example in "calc.bat".

Then, check that "% cfg.GBSolver = @gbs_findAlgB_macaulay;" line in 
"generator\gbs_InitConfig.m" is uncommented. This will enable Macaulay 
Groebner basis solver in the solvers generator.


Custom Groebner basis solver
----------------------------

Note that "cfg.GBSolver" is any function of the form:

    [algB res] = GBSolver(cfg, eq, known, unknown);

which returns basis of algebra B (please refer to the paper) given list of 
equations, known and unknown variables. By default, the package contains 
"gbs_findAlgB_macaulay" and "gbs_findAlgB_maple" which are wrappers to 
Macaulay2 and Maple Groebner basis solvers. However, you can implement your 
own wrapper.


Using matrix patitioning
------------------------

To enable matrix patitioning change variable "cfg.cfg.matrixPartitioning" 
in config file "generator\gbs_InitConfig.m" according to the description in 
this file.

This package uses tool PaToH to partition sparse matrices to speed up the 
Gauss-Jordan eliminations. This tool is not available for Windows. To 
download this tool see "http://bmi.osu.edu/~umit/software.html#patoh" or 
use downloaded packages located in "prerequisites/PaToH/". For installation 
see instructions enclosed in these packages.


Limitations
-----------

This package has been tested on Matlab 2015 64bit and 32bit. Code 
generator does not handle all cases when basis of algebra A does not 
contain action matrix variable. Then, eigenvalues of the action matrix are 
solutions to the action variable and corresponding eigenvectors contain 
solution to remaining unknowns.


First test
----------

To add all required paths run script "setpaths.m".

Set of some examples of minimal problems are stored in folder 
"minimalProblems". To generate solver for some exmaple execute function 
"gbs_GenerateSolver(nameOfMinimalProblem)", for example 
"gbs_GenerateSolver('sw6pt')". All examples of minimal problems are self 
explanatory and will teach you how to use the generator.

The solver generator must be called from its root directory (the place, 
where "setpath.m" file is located).
