Introduction
------------

This software package contains Groebner basis solvers generator as 
described in paper

Kukelova Z., Bujnak M., Pajdla T., Automatic Generator of Minimal 
Problem Solvers, ECCV 2008, Marseille, France, October 12-18, 2008

Please refer to the license.txt for licensing details.

MS Windows Installation
--------------------

This package does not require any installation. Package contains all 
necessary modules. By default the solvers generator uses Maple to compute 
Groebner basis (GB). We recommend to install Macaulay2 since it provides 
better GB solver.

Please refer to "generator\gbs_InitConfig.m" for further generator 
configuration. The file should be self explanatory enough.


Groebner basis solver
---------------------

We recommend to install Macaulay2 software package which provides fast and 
stable Groebner basis solver. 
Download it from "http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/" or install one 
located in prerequisites directory ("macaulay2-0.9.2-3.msi"). 

After installing the package, update all "!!TODO:" labeled items in 
"gbsMacaulay\calc.bat". Please remove "!!TODO:" label and fill correct full
paths to Macaulay2 installation directory according to example in "calc.bat".

Then, uncomment "% cfg.GBSolver = @gbs_findAlgB_macaulay;" line in 
"generator\gbs_InitConfig.m". This will enable Macaulay Groebner basis 
solver in the solvers generator.


Custom Groebner basis solver
----------------------------

Note that "cfg.GBSolver" is any function of the form:

    [algB res] = GBSolver(cfg, eq, known, unknown);

which returns basis of algebra B (please refer to the paper) given list of 
equations, known and unknown variables. By default, the package contains 
"gbs_findAlgB_macaulay" and "gbs_findAlgB_maple" which are wrappers to 
Macaulay2 and Maple Groebner basis solvers. However, you can implement your 
own wrapper.


Limitations
-----------

This package has been tested on Matlab 2014 64bit and 32bit. Code 
generator does not handle all cases when basis of algebra A does not 
contain action matrix variable. Then, eigenvalues of the action matrix are 
solutions to the action variable and corresponding eigenvectors contain 
solution to remaining unknowns.


First test
----------

Open one of the testing files "sw6pttest.m" or "sw5pttest.m" and execute 
the code. Both examples are self explanatory and will teach you how to use 
the generator.

The solver generator must be called from its root directory (the place, 
where "setpath.m" file is located)
